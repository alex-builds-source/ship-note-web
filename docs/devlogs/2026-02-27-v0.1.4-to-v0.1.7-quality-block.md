# ship-note-web quality block (v0.1.4 → v0.1.7)

## What shipped
Over this block, ship-note-web focused on destination-output quality and agent-usage reliability.

### v0.1.4
- Improved destination readability by reducing code/meta-heavy wording in social/update output.
- Added destination quality report generation (`dogfood:quality`).

### v0.1.5
- Added quality threshold enforcement (`dogfood:quality:check`).
- Added auto-generated tuning backlog (`dogfood:todo`).

### v0.1.6
- Added operations workflow docs for non-interactive-safe deploys.
- Added deployment housekeeping script with dry-run default.
- Updated CI to enforce quality checks and snippet drift checks.

### v0.1.7
- Added destination snapshot test coverage.
- Added quality scoring guide docs.
- Further tuned wording normalization for audience-facing outputs.

## Why this matters
- Output quality is now measured and gated, not subjective.
- Agent integration docs and quality checks now move together.
- Deploy + maintenance workflows are less fragile in automation contexts.

## Validation
- `npm test`
- `npm run snippets:check`
- `npm run dogfood:destinations`
- `npm run dogfood:quality:check`
- `repo-preflight --strict --compact`
- `gitleaks git --redact`
