# AGENTS.md

## Purpose
This project is designed to be easy for both AI agents and humans to operate.

## Rules of engagement
- Prefer explicit CLI/API contracts over implicit behavior.
- Keep README and docs in sync with code.
- Add examples whenever adding a new command or endpoint.
- Never commit secrets, tokens, private keys, or sensitive logs.
